We can record unhappiness levels, and compare them to the happiness 
levels and see if they are comparatively
better

objective: randomly organize groups into different "buckets" and measure happiness levels,
maximizing the happiness. As an add-on we measure unhappiness, where we see how many groups
do not have the people they asked for (add up how many zeros there are). We will start by accepting
the csv with the names and lists, the lists will be put into a list of lists,
and then the buckets will be randomly formed. From there, each individual will be compared to the
rest of the bucket, and a counter for happiness and unhappiness will be taken into account. 
Afterwards, the buckets will be randomly swapped, and the same process will continue again, this
time comparing happiness and unhappiness to the previous group, and if this instance is better then
it becomes the new bucket system, if not the previous, and this process will continue for at least
3 times (maybe the factorial of the group size if the program can handle it).
