Member Reflections:

Matthew: 
	I have experience with not only Java, Github, and working with algorithms, but I 
	also have experience with working in groups and managing time, resources, and communicating properly with other team members. I always make sure that I accomplish some task in any group meeting, and when I have done good enough, I go even further to achieve a higher accomplishment. 
	
Adam:
	I will use my communication and teamwork to get the team together and work on 
	the parts that I need to get done. Since I already have some experience in Java, I will be able to code without having to learn the whole language. When I get the parts needed done, I will try to go above and do more with the project.
